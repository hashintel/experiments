# hCore Business Process Modeling Plugin

## Overview

This [HASH Core] (**hCore**) plugin was initially developed as a proof-of-concept in March 2021 with the goal of demonstrating how plugins could be developed for hCore, and in a bid to provide a new graphical interface for capturing business process models for use in HASH simulations.

This plugin was open-sourced alongside hCore ([co-located in this repo](https://github.com/hashintel/labs/tree/main/apps/sim-core)) in 2023. **Please note: this plugin is unmaintained, outdated, and not recommended for use in production.**

## Contributing

This project is currently unmaintained and we will not be accepting pull requests for it. If you would like to discuss undertaking a major upgrade or revitalization of the plugin to make it useful,[open an issue](https://github.com/hashintel/labs/issues) on this repo, mentioning the **Process Modeler plugin for hCore**.

## Built with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). View the full [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)to learn more.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
