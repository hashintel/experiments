# Labs
ðŸ§ª Public laboratory for experiments

This repository contains code snippets, examples and experimental work made public. Projects from our private [internal-labs](https://github.com/hashintel/internal-labs) monorepo for experiments will be moved here and published when safe and practical to do so.

# Projects

- [`distributed_collab`](./distributed_collab) - **Distributed Collab**: a BEAM VM based system for publishing/subscribing to JSON Patches with core logic implemented in Rust.
- [`hash_helm_chart`](./hash_helm_chart) - **HASH Helm Charts**: An experimental [Helm](https://helm.sh) chart for deploying an instance of HASH on Kubernetes.
