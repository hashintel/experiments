# License

Our `labs` monorepo contains **open-source code** variously licensed under either:
- the [MIT License] and [Apache License 2.0] dually (default);
- the [GNU Affero General Public License 3.0]; or
- the [Elastic License 2.0].

## 1. License Determination

**The following rules apply on the `main` branch only.** The license for a particular work is defined in accordance with the following prioritized rules (precedence established first-to-last):

1.  **If present:** license information directly present in the work file defines its license;
1.  **Else, if:** the work exists directly or indirectly inside a directory titled `_h`, the file is available under the [HASH License] only;
1.  **Else, if:** a `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file exists in the same directory as the work, this defines its license;
1.  **Else, if:** a `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file is found when exploring parent directories of the work up to the project top level directory, the first one encountered defines the license applicable to the work;
1.  **Otherwise:** by default, the work is dually available under both the [MIT License] and [Apache License 2.0], at your option.

No license is granted by HASH to work or files on branches other than `main`.
